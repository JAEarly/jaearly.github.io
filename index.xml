      <description>arXiv Preprint November 2023 Inherently Interpretable Time Series Classification via Multiple Instance Learning Joseph Early, Gavin KC Cheung, Kurt Cutajar, Hanting Xie, Jas Kandola, Niall Twomey Conventional Time Series Classification (TSC) methods are often black boxes that obscure inherent interpretation of their decision-making processes. In this work, we leverage Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) to overcome this issue, and propose a new framework called MILLET: Multiple Instance Learning for Locally Explainable Time series classification.</description>

      <description>Bio Joseph is a doctoral student with the University of Southampton and the Alan Turing Institute. He completed an Integrated MEng Computer Science degree at the University of Southampton, specialising in machine learning. Joseph continued to pursue his interest in machine learning and is now in the final year of his PhD. His PhD research focuses on interpretable machine learning – the process of unpacking the “black box” of artificial intelligence and understanding why models exhibit certain behaviours.</description>
