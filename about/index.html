<h3> Bio </h3>

<p>
Joseph is a doctoral student with the <a href="https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><b>University of Southampton</b></a> and the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><b>Alan Turing Institute</b></a>. He completed an <b>Integrated MEng Computer Science</b> degree at the University of Southampton, specialising in machine learning. Joseph continued to pursue his interest in machine learning and is now in the final year of his PhD.
</p>

<p>
His PhD research focuses on <b>interpretable machine learning</b> – the process of unpacking the “black box” of artificial intelligence and understanding why models exhibit certain behaviours. In addition to academic work, Joseph has also been involved in industry through a six-month <b>Applied Science Internship with Amazon Prime Video</b> in London, where he lead a research project on interpretable time series classification. 
</p>

<p>
Joseph is motivated by collaboration within academia and industry, with a strong interest in helping others apply and understand machine learning in their domains. He believes a drive towards <b>openness, transparency and explainability</b> in artificial intelligence will allow the recent advances in machine learning to spread and contribute to other areas. He has previously collaborated on projects involving <b>medicine, climate change, and law</b> - projects that lead to publications in leading journals and conferences. 
</p>

<p>
Joseph also has experience working in the <b>start-up industry</b>. Using his specialist machine learning knowledge, he contributed to a start-up within the University of Southampton during his master’s degree. Joseph is also the co-founder of the <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/interest-groups/entrepreneurship" target="_blank"><b>Entrepreneurship Interest Group</b></a> at the Alan Turing Institute. During his PhD he has been heavily involved in undergraduate teaching – running lab sessions for modules such as Intelligent Agents and Foundations of Machine Learning.
</p>

<h3> Research Interests </h3>

<p>
Joseph’s doctoral research primarily focuses on <b>interpretable machine learning</b>. With the recent rise and successes of deep learning, increasing concern has been raised over the <b>“black box”</b> nature of modern machine learning models and the lack of understanding around how they make predictions. Interpretable machine learning represents a drive towards <b>open, transparent, and fair models</b> that are easily understandable. Through analysis of models and data, interpretable machine learning can be used to expose bias and shine the light on the inner workings of machine learning.
</p>

<p>
Within the broad scope of interpretable machine learning, Joseph’s specific focus is on <b>Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)</b>, where data is organised into bags of instances, and each bag is given a single label. This is in contrast to standard supervised learning, in which every instance is given its own label. MIL decision-making is often only dependent on a few key instances in a bag, therefore the aim of interpreting the model is to <b>identify these key instances</b> and understand why they are being used to make decisions.
</p>

<p>
As part of his PhD, Joseph collaborated with the Cancer Science Research Group at the University of Southampton. The collaboration focused on <b>predicting response to treatment of cancer</b>, and utilised interpretable machine learning to understand the link between histopathology data and patient response. He has also worked on interpretable <b>computer vision for high-resolution satellite imaging</b> for applications in climate change monitoring.
